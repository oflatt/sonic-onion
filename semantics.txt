There is but one data type available to the user: the Song

Internally, a song is a tree of streams of notes, an anchor, and a duration
Song : {notes : Tree (Stream Note)
       anchor : float
       duration : float}

A note has a duration, frequency, and volume, ect
Note(duration, frequency, volume)


Typing a number literal $n$ coerces it into
{leaf Note(duration = n, 0, 0), n, n}

The duration of a song is the time when it ends.
The anchor is the atatchment point for new songs.

Arithmetic operators perform on songs and return songs whose volume is 0

The + operator returns
  song whose volume is 0 and ...

Join operator : Lazily join two streams


Min operator :
    Given two streams, compute the min anchor_time between them.
    Runs infinitely if given two infinite streams with no end time defined.
    


Plus operator 
  Adds duration of each song together
